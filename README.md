# Real-Time Code Editor & Sorting Visualizers

Welcome to the repository for the Real-Time Code Editor and Sorting Visualizers project! This project is a demonstration of sorting algorithms using visualizations and includes a real-time code editor for a dynamic learning experience.

## About the Project

The project combines a real-time code editor and sorting algorithm visualizations to provide an interactive platform for learning and understanding various sorting techniques. Users can experiment with code in real-time and witness the visual representation of sorting algorithms to deepen their understanding of algorithmic concepts.

## Features

- **Real-Time Code Editor:** Write and execute code in real-time to experiment with different sorting algorithms.
- **Sorting Visualizers:** Dynamic visualizations of popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
- **Algorithm Explanations:** Brief explanations of each sorting algorithm to aid understanding.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures an optimal user experience on a variety of devices.
